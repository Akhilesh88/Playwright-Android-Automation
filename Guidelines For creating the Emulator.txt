Enviornment Variable For Android studio:-
Android SDK environment variables:-
ANDROID_HOME:Sets the path to the SDK installation directory. Once set, the value does not typically change and can be shared by multiple users on the same machine.
	     ANDROID_SDK_ROOT, which also points to the SDK installation directory, is deprecated. If you continue to use it, 
	     Android Studio and the Android Gradle plugin will check that the old and new variables are consistent.
ANDROID_USER_HOME:Sets the path to the user preferences directory for tools that are part of the Android SDK. Defaults to $HOME/.android/.
		  Some older tools, such as Android Studio 4.3 and earlier, do not read ANDROID_USER_HOME. To override the user preferences location for those older tools, set ANDROID_SDK_HOME to the parent directory you would like the .android directory to be created under.

1.ANDROID HOME :- ANDROID_HOME/tools, ANDROID_HOME/tools/bin, and ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools.
2.To set Java Environment Variables, you need to set,
	JAVA_HOME: It points to the directory where the JDK is installed on the system.
	PATH: It specifies where the operating system should look for executable files.

Step 1: Download and install the latest JDK from the official Oracle website. To know how to download JDK on Windows OS, refer to this article: How to Install Java on Windows, Linux and 	macOS?
Step 2: Set JAVA_HOME
	Click Windows + S, search for “Environment Variables”, and click Edit the system environment variables. In the System Properties window, click Environment Variables.
	Now, go to Environment Variable > System Variable section > click New.
Step 3: Now we need to update the PATH variable. For this, open the C: drive, go to Program Files > Java > jdk-23 > bin folder, then copy the path.
	To verify the Java compiler, run the below command:
	Javac -version 

SDK Tools 
differences between tools, platform-tools and build-tools:

Android SDK Tools
	Location: $ANDROID_HOME/tools
Main tools: ant scripts (to build your APKs) and ddms (for debugging)
Android SDK Platform-tools
	Location: $ANDROID_HOME/platform-tools
Main tool: adb (to manage the state of an emulator or an Android device)
Android SDK Build-tools
	Location: $ANDROID_HOME/build-tools/$VERSION/
